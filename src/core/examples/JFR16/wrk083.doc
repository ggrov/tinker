\section{PROVING MORPHISMHOOD}
%%%%
%%%%

\subsection{Representing $\lambda$-abstractions using first-order combinators}

\subsubsection{The approach: a rewrite system}

We assume given a set of unary operators, binary operators and
parametrized operators (such $x^n$ viewed as an operator on $x$ parametrized by $n$) that are primitive morphisms in some concrete category of interest.
We expect the projections $\pi_i : X_1 \times X_2 \To X_i$ to be included amongst the unary operators.
We also assume give some set of constant elements of selected objects
in the category.

We want to convert a $\lambda$-abstraction whose body is a first-order formula built using the given operators, constants and the pairing operator $\_, \_)$ into an equivalent function expressed using the combinators of a category with binary products.
We do this using the following rewrite system, where $V$ denotes a {\em variable structure}, i.e., $V$ is a pattern formed from variables using pairing (such that each free variable of $V$ appears exactly once in $V$).

\[
\begin{array}{rcl@{\quad\quad}l}
(\lambda V \bullet x) &\leadsto& \pi^V_x
	& \mbox{if $x \in \Frees(V)$} \\
(\lambda V \bullet y) &\leadsto& \K\,y
	& \mbox{if $y \not\in \Frees(V)$} \\
(\lambda V \bullet c) &\leadsto& \K\,c
	& \mbox{if $c \in \Constant$} \\
(\lambda V \bullet (t_1, t_2)) &\leadsto& \langle(\lambda V\bullet t_1), (\lambda V\bullet t_2)\rangle
	&  \\
(\lambda V \bullet f\,t) &\leadsto& f \circ (\lambda V\bullet t)
	& \mbox{if $f \in \Unary$} \\
(\lambda V \bullet g\,t_1\,t_2) &\leadsto& \Uncurry\,g \circ \langle(\lambda V\bullet t_1), (\lambda V\bullet t_2)\rangle
	& \mbox{if $g \in \Binary$} \\
(\lambda V \bullet h\,t\,p) &\leadsto& (\lambda x\bullet h\,x\,p) \circ (\lambda V\bullet t)
	& \mbox{if $h \in \Parametrized$} \\
\end{array}
\]

Here, if $V$ is a varstruct with a free occurrence of the variable $x$,
$\pi^V_x$ denotes the combination of projections which extracts $x$.
For example $\pi^{((z, x), y)}_x$ is $\pi_2 \circ \pi_1$.
As a special case, $\pi^x_x = \I$ and we may simplify $f \circ I$ to $f$.

%Note that if pairing is implemented by taking `,' to be a binary operator
%of type $\alpha \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \alpha \times \beta$,
%the rule for pairing is subsumed by the rule for binary operators
%together with a simplification rule $\Upsilon (,) = \iota$.
=TEX
\subsubsection{Implementation}

We prove template theorems that support the various clauses of the rewrite system.

When we instantiate the template theorems, we want to rename type variables to avoid capture, we use the following utility to help with this.

	let	fun aux (s, (av, res)) = (

The derived rule

		val thm' = inst_type_rule (combine (map mk_vartype thm_tyvs') (map mk_vartype thm_tyvs)) thm;
	in	µ_elim tm thm'

The derived rule

all_µ_intro1

\ gives the universal closure of a theorem but leaving the free variables
of a specified term that are not included in a supplied list of ``pattern variables'' free.

\subsection{Moprhismhood Tactic}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now we build the basic morphismhood tactic.
It expects a goal of the form
=INLINEFT
f  (X, Y) Morphism
=TEX
.
The tactic begins by È-expanding $f$ if it not already an abstraction.
=SML

val  ÛÈ_expand_convÝ : CONV = (fn tm => (
	if	is_Ì tm
	then	fail_conv
	else	simple_eq_match_conv È_expand_thm) tm);

=TEX
The theorem is parametrized by a list of theorems that are used
as an initial set of rewrite rules. For convenience, we convert
any paired abstractions in these theorems into simple abstractions,
which makes them more general as rewrite rules.
=SML

val Ûunpair_rewrite_tacÝ : THM list -> TACTIC = 
	rewrite_tac o map (conv_rule (TRY_C (MAP_C Ì_unpair_conv)));
=TEX
Now the tactic. After the È-expansion and rewriting discussed above,
it converts the function into combinator form.
It then goes through a cycle of backchaining with implicative facts
applying the supplied tactic to guess
existential witnesses, then stripping and rewriting with the basic facts.
=SML
fun Ûbasic_morphism_tacÝ
	{
		unary : TERM list,
		binary : TERM list,

The following constructs witnesses to objecthood using a supplied list of object constructors based on the type of the desired witness.
Each object constructor is given with a list of type variables that are not to be instantiated in the search for a witness.
=SML

				val tysubs0 = map (fn tv => (mk_vartype tv, mk_vartype tv)) tvs;
				val arg_tys = rev (tl rev_tys);
			in	preprocess ((res_ty,  (oc, tysubs0, arg_tys)) :: acc) more
			end
		);
		val table = preprocess [] ocs;
		fun solve [] ty = fail "object_by_type" 1005 []

In the following, the list of strings with each object constructor is a list of type variables that are not to be instantiated when matching with this constructor. Typically these would be type variables appearing in the type of something which is an object by dint of an assumption of the goal.
